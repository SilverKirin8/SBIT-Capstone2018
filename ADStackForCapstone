Description: >-
    This stack deploys and configures Active Directory domain controllers into an existing VPC environment. This stack makes use of the outputs from the 
    "VPCEnvironmentForCapstone" stack. 
    
    
    This stack will deploy the instances and, through the use of cfn-init/resource metadata, will install ADDS and 
    configure the instance as a domain controller.
    
    At this point, I haven't decided if this stack will be static for demo purposes. If so, this stack will deploy a hard-coded pair of DCs, the first 
    creating the forest and domain, and the second being joined and then promoted. 
    If this stack is not static, I might create two similar stacks, one to create the domain and forest, and a second for all other instances that 
    will be joined. I could also try to add conditions to the metadata putting both functions in the same stack. More research required to decide.
    At this time, I will likely create the static stack for the sake of simplicity Iand the fact that I don't care about making the project look good 
    anymore).
